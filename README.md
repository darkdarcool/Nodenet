# Nodenet

This is a clone of dotnet... for node!

This helps you run tests(via jest & chitchat) and allow you code your node projects ***faster***.

# Installation

You must have node installed, which if you don't have, you can get [here](https:///nodejs.org).

Once you have it installed, please in your terminal do:

``` bash
we don't have on yet!
```
Then you can start using Nodenet! Nodenet is ***not*** meant for requiring it in code. While nothing will happen if you do, it will just be a waste of codespace.

# Usage

Please visit our [Usage](https://github.com/darkdarcool/Nodenet/blob/master/docs/Usage.md) readme for information on how to use Nodenet. 

# Contributing

This is meant for a project for me to do myself, so I will probably not invite you, but if you really want to, you can make a pull request and or issue to request new features, ect.

# Conclusion

I hope that you enjoy this and use it, and I'll see you later! 

Bye!
